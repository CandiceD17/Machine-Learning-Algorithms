    "The results are not similar. For hard margin SVM, it necessitates that all the data points are of certain margin to the decision boundary. However, in higher dimensions, our data cannot be separated neatly by a hyperplane. In such case, hard margin SVM uses all the points as support vectors, so it requires all the points are outside of the margin and thus it leaves little margin in between. Consequently, the small margin does not provide us with a well-separated decision boundary, and the test accuracy for hard SVM is far below the soft SVM case.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, the soft SVM allows some extent of misclassifications as well as allowing some points inside the margin. As a result, we have only 38 support vectors, leading to a larger margin and less overfitting than the hard SVM case. The larger margin gives rise to a more robust decision boundary and leads to an almost perfect test accuracy."

This is possibly because that the high-dimensional polynomial transformation of the data points still cannot give us a boundary that separate them clearly.

    "The result is indeed better than both the linear kernel and the polynomial kernel. As introduced in lecture, the Gaussian kernel gives us a mapping which is infinite in the dimension of x. That is to say, we can treat the Guassian kernel as a polynomial kernel with infinite dimensions. As a result, the Gaussian kernel can be generalized to different kinds of distributions, and it gives us the bell-shaped surface centered at each support vector."

That is to say, Gaussian kernel can be well adopted to different kinds of distributions.
